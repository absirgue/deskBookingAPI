# deskBookingAPI

This is the first version of an API for a desk booking app project called NeWork.

Features handled by this API include:
- registering as a company on our service
- creating desks as a company for your employees to be able to book
- signing up as a user
- logging in as a user
- booking a desk as a user. Desk bookings allow you to book a desk at a specific date with preferences that you can indicate on the app (2 choices of preference that are declared by your company) ex: Company1 selects 'close to the coffee machine' and 'near a window' as its two preferences; employees from Company1 will be able to indicate whether they want they want their desk to be 'close to the coffee machine' or 'near a window' or both or neither and our API will find the best-fitting desk available
- creating an invite (feature not fully implemented as of now): allows User1 to invite a co-worker or all members of his team to book a desk close to his on a specific date in order to work together
